Snowman Builder Extreme
=======================

_"The best European low-budget PSX game of 1996"_ â€” The Virtual Herald 

What would have happened if a very small group on a budget in 1996 cranked out a quick PSX title on such a small timescale and without artists but with the internet and browser capabilities of 2015?

[Play Online Now](http://zenmumbler.net/ld34/) or [Play smaller itch.io edition](http://stardazed.itch.io/snowman-builder-extreme).

A game where the premise is that the best way to make a snowman is to kick it down a slope littered with snowman adornments and let fate handle the rest. 
You can help fate a bit by pressing the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS to steer the snowball around a bit, but it moves forward by itself. 

It features a free Ska-ish song by good old Kevin MacLeod. Why Ska? The 90s! That's why. The whole experience of this game is an homage to 90s 3D games. 

It even works on some mobile devices, where you can tilt the device to steer, verified to work on iPhones 5s and up and on a few Android phones.

There are 16 titles to be gained by picking up certain numbers of certain adornments and/or being really fast. Be sure to collect 'em all!
